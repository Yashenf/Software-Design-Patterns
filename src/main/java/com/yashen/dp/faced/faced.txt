Faced Design Pattern {Structural Design Pattern}
pronounce this as :- (Fasaad)

"Create Simplified interface for complex set of classes." (Hide Complexity)

Mostly use this in Libraries , Frameworks .

complex process with many classes , many interfaces with Simplify interface.
it's simplify our work.
manage file structure and manage process internally also. access via single window.


Don't mess-up after looking this packages and classes , how they work together, witch class we start , sequence order.... it's just example!
in that example , we don't know about packages , classes , interfaces... it's know only developer.
we need some simplified documentation.
